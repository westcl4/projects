# Octoprint

My Octoprint project was a third-year project that I performed at Otago Polytechnic's Bachelor of IT. My intention for the project was to implement the very feature-rich Octoprint Operating System on the 3D Printers used at BIT. More information on the Octoprint OS can be found on the official website: https://octoprint.org/

Octoprint features:
- A remotely-accessed web interface for each individual printer
- Access to a webcam feed to remotely monitor prints
- Remote print file upload
- A curated 3rd party extension repository to add features to Octoprint
- Exposes information about the printers to an API
- ...And more!

My vision for the project was as follows:
- Implement Octoprint on the school's 3D printers
- Create documentation so that anyone could easily replicate the work I had done and start from where I left off
- Create a website that takes the data from the APIs of several printers to give an overview of all printers at a glance
- This website can also serve as a homepage for all 3D-printer related activity at BIT (Guides, Code of conduct, etc.)

My main goal was to help reduce the common frustrations of using 3D printers, particularly the Creality Enders used by the school. I also wanted to enhance the features and increase accessibility to people who were disabled or injured and for whatever reason had trouble with using the Ender's primitive 3D printer interfaces.
